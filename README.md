# Prework Study Guide Project

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created to assist student developers with information that will be covered in bootcamp. It contains notes on what I learned in the Prework modules, such as basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. This webpage allows essential notes to be kept and organized in one space. When faced with an issue, I learned about the importance of correct spacing of codes in order to debug it.
